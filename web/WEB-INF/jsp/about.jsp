                                            I write code, try to design software and sometimes I even dream of new application ideas.<br />
                                            I graduated Applied Information Technology University College Ghent in 2013 with honors. Several 
                                            studentjobs and personal projects convinced me that working on projects suits me more than continuing 
                                            an academic career. This is why I currently am looking for a job

                                            I am curious by nature. I like to know how things function, why certain things happen. This interest is not limited to the computer science field,
                                            it extends to some of the most mundane things in our everyday life. This has led to what I believe to be a good and solid general knowledge. 
                                            This curious and inquisitive mind-set allows me to quickly learn new skills
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I am an only child, so I am capable of working by myself. Luckily a large family and numerous sports clubs have made it so that I can
                                            also work together in a group. A year as cub-scout leader and some limited experience as a teacher have shown me how to behave and give 
                                            direction to group of people.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            One of the many advantages of still being young, is that I am capable of quickly learning new skills and adapting to new environments. 
                                            For me it is no problem to have to work "strange" hours or weekends. This also means that I am willing to put in extra hours and long days
                                            to resolve problematic situations.
