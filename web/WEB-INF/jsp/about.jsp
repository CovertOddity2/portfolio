                                            I write code, try to design software and sometimes I even dream of new application ideas.<br />
                                            I graduated Applied Information Technology University College Ghent in 2013 with honors. Several internships,  
                                            student jobs and personal projects convinced me that working on projects suits me more than continuing 
                                            an academic career.

                                            I am curious by nature. I like to know how things function, why things happen. This interest is not limited to only the computer science field,
                                            it extends to some of the most mundane things in our everyday life. This has led to a broad knowledge base and an open mind. 
                                            This curious and inquisitive mind-set allows me to quickly learn new skills and adopt new practices.

                                        <p>
                                            I am an only child, so I am used to working by myself. Luckily a large family and numerous sports clubs have made it so that I can
                                            also work together in a group. A some years as gymnastics trainer and some limited experience as a teacher have shown me how to behave
                                            in a team and how give direction and instructions to group of people.

                                            One of the many advantages of still being young, is that for me it is no problem to have to work "strange" hours or weekends.
                                            This also means that I am willing to put in extra hours and long days to resolve problematic situations.
