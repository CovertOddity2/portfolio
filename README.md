My portfolio site

This site is supposed to be HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript compliant.
Until a better solution is found this site will be the static html pages generated by the Spring project rework.
This is because I fear I might break some apache / tomcat configuration for 'production' sites running on the VPS

Once a solution has been found, this branch will become the publicised site and development on the main will stop

Rework Mark III
----

Started a new project so that maven can be used to manage the required libraries.
The plans is to use the Spring framework again, this time with hibernate and JPA connecting to mariaDB running on the server.
