My portfolio site

This site is supposed to be HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript compliant.
Until a better solution is found this site will be the static html pages generated by the Spring project rework.
This is because I fear I might break some apache / tomcat configuration for 'production' sites running on the VPS

Once a solution has been found, this branch will become the publicised site and development on the main will stop

TODO
----

Change the implemented service to use a databased via the hibernate framework
